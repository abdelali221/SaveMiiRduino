# SaveMiiRduino
 SaveMii module using Arduino

This program can be used to enter the Wii's Recovery Mode, just like the SaveMii Module.

# What you'll need...

- A 16Mhz Arduino (Atmega328/P works fine).
- A Logic Level Converter (To convert the 5v to 3.3v).
- A GameCube Controller Cable.

# How to Use : 

Simply follow this diagram :

I recommend powering the Arduino from the GameCube controller cable, so the Wii and the Arduino Powers on at the same time.
